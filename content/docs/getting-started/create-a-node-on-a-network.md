# Create a Node on a Network

## Introduction

OnFinality makes it easy to create new nodes on various supported networks. 

In minutes, you can have a new node online on any cloud of your choosing. This guide will use Kusama to show you how, but is also relevant to any other network including the existing public networks already in OnFinality.

## Steps

### Get Started

1. Login to your OnFinality workspace.
1. Click on `Dedicated Nodes`. 
1. In the upper right corner, click on `Deploy New Node`.



### Select a Network

The first page will allow you to select what network you want to create a new node in. 

This list will show the following:
- public networks that OnFinality supports
- any private or custom network that you've already added. 

Lets create a Kusama network, so we'll click on `Polkadot - Kusama`.

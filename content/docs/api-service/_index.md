### What is our API service

It's a fully managed infrastructure solution for blockchain developers across the Polkadot network. You can access shared nodes on different networks instantly and securely.

- Managed for you - We will do all the hard work for you in terms of infrastructure maintenance.
- Fee to Start - During the beta phase, our API Service will be free so that we can test and improve our services as quickly as possible. We will keep a generous free tier when we end the beta phase so that you can still try new things.
-  Scalable - We will take care of scalability and resiliency so you can access nodes that are close to you and your users.
- Global - Our load balancers will distribute your requests to the closest node to your users, use our API Service to scale with performance from day 1.
- Monitoring - We're building our dashboard to give your the monitoring that you need on your requests and app performance so that you can understand and serve your users better.
- Documentation - We're all started somewhere, we plan to help all new to blockchain development with easy to use developer getting started documentation.

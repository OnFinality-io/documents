# Getting Started

Registering and getting access to the API Service only takes a few minutes. We've designed the process to be as easy as possible.


# Login to OnFinality

First, go to app.onfinality.io to create an account in OnFinality or log on using your existing account if you already have one. Logging into OnFinality

Once you're in, go to to the API Service page.


The API Service page currently has three sections; a daily request indicator, the API key detail, and a usage graph.

# Daily Request Indicator

Our API Service plans are billed based on the number of requests per day. As shown above, our free tier currently includes 500,000 requests that reset every 24 hours. This section clearly shows how many requests you have consumed in the progress bar and exactly when your daily usage count resets.

# API Key 

For each network, we provide you with two enpoints:
1. an HTTPS
1. Websocket connection.  

You can click on the Polkadot and Kusama network names above to switch between the displayed network URLs.

These URLs include your API key, which is private and unique to your account. You cannot let anyone know your API key, and you should do as much as possible to protect it and keep it secret as it is directly linked to your billing account. If you believe that your API key is in use by an unauthorized third party, then you can use the Regenerate Key button the reset it.

# Usage Graph

The usage graph shows you the volume of API requests made to your account over the last 24 hours or 30 days. You are viewing all blockchains by default, but can also filter down the request to a specific blockchain.
Get Connected

The next step for you is to connect to your new API service account and start developing! Take a look at an example of how to do this here.

## Connect to API Service using the Polkadot/Substrate App

Once you have your[ API service enabled and running](https://support.onfinality.io/hc/en-us/articles/900004222183) (see[ API Service - Getting Started](https://support.onfinality.io/hc/en-us/articles/900004222183)) you can now connect to it and start using it in your dApps.

**Our API Service is currently in beta. We've got big plans for it, but please treat it as such and avoid running production applications on it.**

We're going to use the Polkadot/Substrate Portal to connect to our API service, but these instructions will also work for other similar methods. 


### **Create Polkadot/Substrate Account**

If you haven't already got one, go to the[ Polkadot UI and create an account](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts). Make sure that you store your mnemonic seed safe somewhere and never provide it to anyone, including us.

### **Connect to the OnFinality API Service**

Head to the Explorer tab under Network, and on the top of your screen click on the Polkadot Icon.

This will open the Network switcher which will allow you to select the network that you connect to. You can add your OnFinality API service endpoint to the Development section by pasting the websocket connection URL into the custom endpoint field and clicking on the save icon.

Congratulations, you're not connected and can start making calls with the Polkadot/Substrate UI App. We can't wait to see that you start building!
